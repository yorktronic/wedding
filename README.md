I got married in late September and since money was tight for the wedding, I ended up writing
a python script that helped to order exactly the correct amount of entrees. In the process of
doing so I created what is probably the most humorous `for` loop I'll ever create:

``` python
for meat in meats:
```
**Everyone got what they wanted and ate until they couldn't eat anymore.*** And we didn't have much
leftover. Anyway, it's a simple little script but maybe it will be useful for people. If not, hopefully it's funny that I did this.
